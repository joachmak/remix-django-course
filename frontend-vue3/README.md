# frontend-vue3

The frontend for this amazing hamster-application is created with Vue3, Typescript and Tailwind.
To make typescript aware of .vue types we need to use the [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin). And also remember to disable Vetur if you are already using that.
If you want to play around with styling, there is also a Tailwind extention that you can use to get automated suggestions.
